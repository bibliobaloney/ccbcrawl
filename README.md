If you download all of this locally and run all the scripts (using runemall.py), it will generate the 3 HTML reports I post to 
https://bibliobaloney.github.io/, plus supporting files. 
If you don't already have them, you'll also need the following libraries installed: bs4, csv, datetime, math, PyPDF2, re, requests, statistics.
I'm a dabbler hobbyist, so I've done all this using Mu (https://codewith.mu/en/). Mu tells me I'm using Python 3.8.11.

Descriptions of individual files, in alphabetical order:
* amendfile.txt - list of cases with orders to amend, generated by otasandoccs.py, for use by closedcases.csv
* casedata.csv - giant CSV file with all cases and lots of fields, generated by ccbcrawl2.py, closedcasepdfs.py, 
   htmltable.py, and otasandoccs.py. Also used by ccbcrawl2 to save re-gathering the same data.
* ccbrawl2.py - script that generates the giant CSV file, by looking up data on docket and claim pages
* certfile.txt - list of cases with orders to certify, generated by otasandoccs.py, for use by closedcaess.csv
* closedcasepdfs.py - script that grabs list of closed cases from the CCB list, tries to infer a reason for dismissal based on
   data about orders to amend or certify, then downloads the PDFs and looks for strings of texts about reasons. Then outputs that information,
   with counts for each reason found, to an html file, and the raw data without the tallies to a CSV
* closedcases.csv - CSV of closed cases, with reasons, output by closedcasepdfs.py
* htmltable.py - script that produces an html report with select fields from casedata.csv, focused on descriptions of infringement
* otasandoccs.csv - CSV file produced by otasandoccs.py, saving info on cases with orders to amend and/or orders certifying claims
* otasandoccs.py - script that collects all the info on cases with orders to amend and/or orders certifying claims, plus does some math
   about how long things are taking, how unrepresented claimants are faring compared to represented ones, current status of claims, etc.
* runemall.py - short script to make everything happen with one click
