Smuin deprived me of the ability to publicize my involvement with this work and with their company, which is a known dance company in the world of contemporary ballet.

The normal penalty for unlicensed music use in the world of music publishing and master recordings is a 3x-10x fee penalty per infringing use.

That total fee was $7000. Smuin rejected it saying they normally paid between $50 - $1500 for music use - which only confirmed my suspicion that Smuin is well aware of its legal obligation to license its music, and in this case, chose not to.

Copies of these complaints are attached, as well as a list of all small claims cases brought against her.

As recently as 2021, a complaint was filed by Amanda Raymond, the writer and director of a feature film Tara Pirnia produced. The cause of action was breach of contract.

I heard back quickly from the producer, Tara Pirnia. She needed a short turnaround on a script for a show about the fashion evolution of Kate Middleton. When I quoted a price of $1000, she talked me into lowering it by half to $500, saying that it was the pilot for a series and she would pay me more for the next script. I agreed. 

She sent me a rough outline that included bullet points for each segment, divided up into nine blocks plus a cold open.

I believe it may also be causing brand confusion between myself and a competing fairy wing maker, HelloFaerie, who engaged in slandering me a few years ago when she was trying to compete in the market. HelloFaerie has been providing Paris with her fairy wings for the last 2 or 3 years. Her business was built upon the foundation my work created.
