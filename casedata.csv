I only discovered this usage when a Cheers fan used the app Shazam to identify me and they reached out to me online. 

I was not aware of this usage because I had not been in my PRO (ASCAP) account since about 2016/17 since switching careers (due to lack of payment for my work, such as this usage). If I had known my work was being used in a Cheers episode, I would have kept my album up for sale. I should be appropriately credited for my work appearing in this episode, including through ISMDb account, so that I can try to actually build more sync opportunities and sell albums. 

In addition to not having a Sync License in place for usage of my work, this work is also coded as ""background music"" on my PRO (ASCAP) cue sheet, which I assume yields lower royalty rates.

I am a junior editor at a small publishing house in Marseille, France, called Le bruit du monde (which roughly translates as ""the sounds of the world""). We are going to publish a translation into French of the memoir/autobiographical essay of a young Norwegian writer and researcher, Jan Grue. In his memoir, he deals with the issue of being a disabled man in a world that isn't meant for him to fit in, and also tells us about how he eventually came to terms with his extra-ordinary being-in-the-world, and learned to accept it. His voice is strong and we wanted to make it heard to French readers. In his book, he reminisces on how living in Amsterdam as an exchange student was both a wonderful and trying experience : the cobblestone streets, the canals, the city itself weren't meant to welcome a person in a wheelchair, and yet he came to love it and its atmosphere. He specifically remembers listening to your song again and again, ""5 am in Amsterdam"". He quotes 5 lines of the song in his book, and we were wondering if we could quote those lines too in our "

The respondents had uploaded the content without any permission of us or the creator of the video. We reached out to them to clear a license to use the video but they refused. This caused us the loss of 500USD per license per URL (Total: 2000USD).

Given the fact that the respondents is a renowned network, who is very aware of the copyright laws and licensing rules, their copyright team did not cooperate when we reached out to them. Neither their PR team. 

They had so many choices before violating our copyright, they could have just texted our client reaching for his permission (other users have done that) or they could have reached out to us to pay the licensing fees. Or at least they should have accepted the licensing offers we submitted to them. But they insisted on violating our rights and refused to license the content.

The respondents had uploaded the content without any permission of us or the creator of the video. We reached out to them to clear a license to use the video but they refused. This caused us the loss of 500USD per license per URL (Total: 1000USD).

Given the fact that the respondents is a renowned network, who is very aware of the copyright laws and licensing rules, their copyright team did not cooperate when we reached out to them. They had so many choices before violating our copyright, they could have just texted our client reaching for his permission (other users have done that) or they could have reached out to us to pay the licensing fees. Or at least they should have accepted the licensing offers we submitted to them. But they insisted on violating our rights and refused to license the content.

The question is: if we or one of our clients has uploaded a sports event owned by BeinMedia Group, would it be ok? Of Course not. Same should apply to BeinMedia Group distributing our content without permission.

BACKGROUND OF THE WORK:

The Work is an approximately 46-minute video featuring a recording of a live stand-up comedy performance by a Comedian.

2) Smuin Ballet used my work to generate income for itself: admission fees, donations, and direct sponsorships from patrons.
3) for a composer, being able to tout and publicize the use of his work by a ballet company is a feather in his cap: it's validation of one's work. Smuin deprived me of the ability to publicize my involvement with this work and with their company, which is a known dance company in the world of contemporary ballet.

That total fee was $7000. Smuin rejected it saying they normally paid between $50 - $1500 for music use - which only confirmed my suspicion that Smuin is well aware of its legal obligation to license its music, and in this case, chose not to.

Respondent competes in a similar type of market and through infringement of Claimant's works has furthered Respondent's YouTube video channel at the diminished and expense of Claimant's YouTube video channel.  Claimant receives revenues from its channel generally through the number of subscribers, views and through paid membership.

The infringed material can be found, on information and belief, beginning at the six minute and 30 second mark of the Respondent's video and concluding at the sixteenth minute and 30 second mark.  The Respondent's infringing work has been taken down by YouTube and can no longer be viewed at this time based on notice given by Claimant of its infringing nature and Claimant's rights in copyright.

In documentation which I will attach I will demonstrate that she has a history of legal actions being brought against her to collect on rents, wages, and other monies that went unpaid due to her repeated deliberate actions meant to defraud others. Copies of these complaints are attached, as well as a list of all small claims cases brought against her.

As recently as 2021, a complaint was filed by Amanda Raymond, the writer and director of a feature film Tara Pirnia produced. The cause of action was breach of contract. In the complaint the Amanda Raymond states that Tara Pirnia had no intention of paying the deferred compensation, contingent compensation or travel expenses as outlined in her contract. A copy of the complaint is attached.

Entertainment Television on the non-fiction series “Celebrity Profile” and “True Hollywood Story,” and had written several award show red carpet scripts for TV Guide Network.) 

I heard back quickly from the producer, Tara Pirnia. She needed a short turnaround on a script for a show about the fashion evolution of Kate Middleton. When I quoted a price of $1000, she talked me into lowering it by half to $500, saying that it was the pilot for a series and she would pay me more for the next script. I agreed. 

She sent me a rough outline that included bullet points for each segment, divided up into nine blocks plus a cold open. After researching and writing the script, I submitted my first draft with my original title “Kate Middleton: Duchess of Style.” Tara praised my work in subsequent emails. She seemed pleased with my writing. I stayed in touch with Tara during the revision process, and she gave me additional note"

Dolls Kill sent a first takedown notice per the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (""DMCA"") to Defendant's service provider on January 31, 2022. The work was removed but more infringing content was discovered in April 2022. Dolls Kill sent another takedown notice and the work was allegedly removed from Defendant's website.

On June 15, 2022 Dolls Kill discovered several additional copies on Defendant's websites. It thus appears that Defendant willfully and repetitively infringes upon Dolls Kill's rights, despite Dolls Kill's efforts to resolve this issue without court intervention."

My infringements of this IP have increased greatly in the last 3 years but especially in the last 2. I believe these infringements played a part in that by giving Paris' viewers the impression that my IP is a freely available work to use should they find it being distributed (illegally) online.
I believe it may also be causing brand confusion between myself and a competing fairy wing maker, HelloFaerie, who engaged in slandering me a few years ago when she was trying to compete in the market. HelloFaerie has been providing Paris with her fairy wings for the last 2 or 3 years. Her business was built upon the foundation my work created.
Since these infringements, I have been incorrectly credited or tagged as the wing maker in posts showing HelloFaerie's work quite a few times.
This has been adding insult to injury.
