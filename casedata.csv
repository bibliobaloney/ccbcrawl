Copying and reproducing ""Sunglass Corner"" in any way, reduces its value. My collectors bought and paid for the emotional sentiment evoked by this image- four elderly men from a different time standing as present day sentries to the Village of Harlem, New York. The high contrast and soft grainy texture is indicative of the style I've created, by using the same materials in processing and printing my images. Reproducing the image cheapens and devalues it tremendously. I've invested years, time and money honing my craft and skill as a self-taught photographer.

In addition, Claimant believes that WRCB-TV, which is an NBC Television affiliate, obtained the Photograph from some other entity within the NBC family of companies, which had many years earlier licensed the Photograph from Corbis/Getty Images. That license expired before WRCB-TV’s use and required the crediting of Claimant in connection with the license. Therefore, at the time of Respondent’s reproduction, display, and distribution of the Photograph on its website, Claimant had not granted Respondent any license or permission to reproduce, publicly display, or otherwise use the Photograph for any purpose.
